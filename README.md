* The scenario I had in mind is about an on-line e-book provider that universities use as a SaaS to allow their students to borrow e-books on-line. The users of this application (the students) can log-in with the credentials provided by their university and download password protected e-books to read offline. Each e-book can be read for a limited time period after which the password expires and there is also a monthly limit of e-books one student can download. This monthly allowance is based on the package purchased by the university the student belongs to.
## Task1: 
* Move classes to their package.
## Task2: 
* Use Dependency Inversion Principle to refactor Class UserService.
## Task3: 
* Use Single Responsibility Principle to refactor Class UserService.
## Task4: 
* Implement fucntion  public void AddBonusAllowances(String universityId) in StudentService follow context: 
* Some University want to add more allowances for their student (10 for premium and 5 for all standard) and Use Open Closed Principle to refactor your code.
## Task5: 
* Give some Talent student can download unlimited book, implement it follow  Liskov Substitution Principle.
## Task6: 
* Do something with Interface Segregation Principle.
